## About this starter

**Folder Structure**

The project follows a well-designed folder structure that promotes organization and modularity in a typical React application:

```
- __tests__                // Test files for the project
- public                   // Public assets and the main HTML file
- src                      // Main codebase of the React application
  - assets                 // Static assets such as images, icons, and stylesheets
  - components             // Reusable UI components used across different pages or layouts
  - constants              // Constant values or configurations
  - contexts               // Context providers and consumers for managing global state
  - hooks                  // Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - layouts                // Layout components defining shared structure and elements
  - pages                  // Page-specific components and related files
  - routes                 // Route configurations and navigation components
  - store                  // Redux-related files (actions, reducers, store configuration)
  - types                  // Custom type declarations or TypeScript interfaces
  - utils                  // Utility functions and helper modules
```
